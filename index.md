I am a PhD student at the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Mathematics of Random Systems](https://www.randomsystems-cdt.ac.uk) at the University of Oxford. My advisor is [Julien Berestycki](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~berestyc/).

Before coming to Oxford, I completed my B.A. and M.A. in mathematics at McGill University. During my master's degree, I worked under the supervision of [Louigi Addario-Berry](http://problab.ca/louigi/) and [Jessica Lin](https://sites.google.com/view/jessicalin-math/home). 

For a full curriculum vitae, see [cv](./doc/CV - Thomas Tendron.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

### Research

I study theoretical models of random phenomena using tools from probability theory and partial differential equations. Such models are often motivated by problems in population genetics, in statistical physics, and increasingly in machine learning. Some questions which arise frequently concern the long-time behaviour of stochastic processes viewed at different scales, the transitions between the microscopic and macroscopic pictures, and the universality of the limits.
